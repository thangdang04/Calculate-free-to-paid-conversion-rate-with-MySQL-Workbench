# Calculating the fraction of students who convert to paying ones after starting a course on the 365 platform
## Overview
In this project, I will help 365 platform analyze data in a relational database with the goal of estimating the free-to-paid conversion rate among students whoâ€™ve engaged with video content on the 365 platform. Moreover, I will also calculate several other key metrics to come up with some interpretations.
## Goals
1. Calculate the free-to-paid conversion rate of students who have watched a lecture on the 365 platform.
2. Calculate the average duration between the registration date and when a student has watched a lecture for the first time.
3. Calculate the average duration between the date of first-time engagement and when a student purchases a subscription for the first time.
4. Provide some interpretations and implications.
